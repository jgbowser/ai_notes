# AI Notes

This repo contains a collection of markdown notes on my AI research.

## Goal

Researching different AI models, products, use cases, etc has ended up being a bit of a convoluted series of rabbit holes for me. This repo will contain directories for each topic I am currently researching. The plan is to be taking notes as I am researching. This will lead to further questions about other topics that will then get their own directory. These notes should be highly interconnected with internal links to related topics/products/whatever. 

## Structure

Each directory will at the very least contain a directory level `README.md` file that will contain an overview of the topic of the directory. From there I don't have a _super_ strong grasp of how this will look, but I imagine there will be things like nested directories for things like example code, perhaps a `TODO.md` file where I can keep track of further research I need to do for the particular topic (if research on the current topic leads to TODO questions on other topics those should be added to that other topic's `TODO.md`).
