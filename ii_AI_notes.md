# Infinity Interactive AI Initiative

This file contains notes and thoughts on how I might organize and oversee II's research into AI and how we can leverage it for out business and clients.

## Background

Up to this point we have had several employees using some of their free time looking into AI tools. So far the focus has mainly been on things like AI Code Assistants (Copilot, Cody, Tabnine) and other developer-focused tools. Progress has been a bit slow on that front as well as far as sharing information and making decisions is concerned. We are now shifting from the developer side of things to focus more on AI applications that we can sell, or even make it easier for us to pursue bids for work more aggressively.

JS wants to take a more focused/organized approach to this where each developer looking into their own topic would give him a 10 - 15 minute lightning style talk. This allows us to share knowledge with him more regularly and allows him to be better informed about our combined knowledge as developers when pursuing clients. I have been asked to oversee this effort. This will include frequent check-ins with JS, developing the planning and scheduling for the effort, and attempting to keep everyone else involved on schedule.

## Initial Thoughts

I will be refining these ideas with JS, but here are some initial thoughts on how this might work

- Weekly presentations seems reasonable assuming we have 3 - 4 devs putting significant time in. This would give each dev about 3 - 4 weeks to research, test, and develop opinions before chatting with JS.
- The idea is that initially we would look into a topic at a high level, give the lightning talk and then make a decision with JS if it is something we should pursue further.
- This may mean 3 - 4 weeks between talks could be too much time to spend on a high level discussion. I think we should try our hardest to have a mix of people digging deep and shallow, this would allow the people working on higher-level research to present more frequently while giving those digging deep a full 3 - 4 weeks to really get familiar with their topic.
- I would like for this to also result in more blog posts and/or pre-happy hour internal lightning talks. Again the point here is to be able to spread knowledge, and find more work.
- Communication for people involved could take place in the `#ai` slack channel, with recurring googleCal meetings set in place to ensure we are staying on top of the meetings and not accidentally blowing them off because other things came up.
- Starting out I think it will just be me and JS chatting so that I can get a good idea of ideas he might already be interested in checking out and rather than me researching specific topics I'll spend a couple weeks trying to build up a backlog of topics to research that can be delegated around. (this repo is the beginning of that work)
- I suspect making integrating and setting up existing AI tools for clients might be the quickest work we could competently do, though I also feel like that may be the most limited path forward. Developing our own ML skills to be able to build more custom solutions for clients is probably the most valuable path forward, but also one that will take significantly more time for us to ramp up to.
